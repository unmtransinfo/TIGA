Genome-wide association studies generate large quantities of association between genomic variations and phenotypic traits. However, assessing strength, specificity and relevance of associations, and semantically valid aggregation of associations, for applications such as drug target prioritization, is challenging.  This project attempts to contribute to this goal.
